						<div className="mt-8 space-y-6 text-[1.0625rem] leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
							<p>
								AI visibility software tracks how your brand appears in AI search — how often it's mentioned, cited, and
								accurately described across ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Google AI Overviews. It answers a question
								traditional analytics can't: when someone asks an AI engine about your category, does it mention you —
								and is it right?
							</p>
							<p>
								Instead of tracking rankings on a results page, it samples the answers themselves — running a defined
								set of prompts across multiple AI engines on a schedule and recording what comes back: whether your
								brand is mentioned, whether it's{" "}
								<a className={LINK} href="/blog/ai-citations">
									cited with a link
								</a>
								, how it's described, and how often competitors appear instead. Good tools roll those signals into a
								share-of-voice metric and point you to the gaps worth closing.

						<div className="mt-8 space-y-6 text-[1.0625rem] leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
							<p>
								Search is shifting from a list of blue links to a synthesized answer. Google now shows{" "}
								<a className={LINK} href="/ai-search/google-ai-overviews">
									AI Overviews
								</a>{" "}
								above the results for many queries, and tools like Perplexity and ChatGPT Search resolve questions
								without a results page at all. For a growing share of searches, buyers read an answer and never click.
							</p>
							<p>
								That changes the unit of visibility. There's often no ranking to hold — there's one answer, and your
								brand is either named in it or it isn't. Being cited becomes the win. This is the premise of{" "}

							<p>
								Elmo is open-source AI visibility software you can self-host. It tracks mentions, citations, and
								competitor share across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity, Copilot, and Google AI Mode and AI
								Overviews — and because it's released under the MIT license, you can read exactly how every metric is
								collected and computed.
							</p>
							<p>
								That matters in a market full of opaque scoring and inflated pricing. With Elmo you own your data and
								avoid vendor lock-in: the self-hosted core is free, and managed cloud hosting is there if you would
								rather not run it. To see how it compares with the rest of the field, read our roundup of the{" "}
