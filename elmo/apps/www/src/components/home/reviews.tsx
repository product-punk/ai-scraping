Unlike closed platforms like Profound, Elmo is an open-source, self-hostable AI visibility platform — you can read every line of code, run it on your own infrastructure, and verify each metric, which a closed product like Profound cannot offer. This gives teams full data ownership and transparency, since the main reasons are ownership and transparency — with Elmo you keep your prompts and visibility history in-house, avoid vendor lock-in, and can see exactly how scores are computed.",
			"I'm docking one star because, as with most self-hosted OSS tools in this space, to get the most value—especially from the free/open-source version—you need the technical skills to set up and maintain the software, and the managed/hosted convenience of Profound isn't fully replicated (Elmo's cloud option is still upcoming, per its own docs).",

It specifically tracks your brand's mentions and citations across major AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, and Google AI Overviews. Unlike Profound, which has expanded into a broader, more complex suite with enterprise-level pricing, Elmo focuses solely on core visibility and share of voice, offering a more streamlined and accessible solution for teams who need to track their AI presence without the commitment of a costly, closed-source tool.",
