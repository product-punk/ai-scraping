	{
		question: "What are the best open-source AEO tools?",
		answer:
			"Elmo is the most complete open-source answer engine optimization tool: MIT-licensed, free to self-host, and covering ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, and Google AI Overviews. Public GitHub data as of 11 August 2026 backs this up — Elmo leads the field on stars, contributors, and releases, and is the only project with a meaningful number of contributors beyond one person. Smaller projects fill out the rest of the space, including OneGlanse, GEO/AEO Tracker, and Gego, most of them single-developer efforts. Canonry is actively developed but source-available rather than fully open source. GetCito replaced its codebase with Elmo's in July 2026, so running it means running a lagging fork of Elmo.",
	},
	{
		question: "What are the best free tools to track brand mentions in ChatGPT?",
		answer:
			"For free tracking that keeps running, self-host an open-source tool: Elmo is MIT-licensed and covers ChatGPT alongside Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, and Google AI Overviews, with no license fee or per-seat charge. Smaller free options include GEO/AEO Tracker, which is local-first and runs entirely in your browser, and Gego, which runs from Docker on a schedule. Free trials from hosted tools work for a one-off check but stop when the trial does. In every case you supply your own model API keys, which carry usage costs, so free means no software licence rather than no spend.",
	},
	{
		question: "Is there a free AI visibility tool?",
		answer:
			"Yes. Open-source trackers are free to use and free to self-host — Elmo, GEO/AEO Tracker, OneGlanse, and Gego all fall into this category. The cost you cannot avoid is model API usage, because measuring visibility means actually running prompts through the engines. A useful rule of thumb: free software plus your own API keys is cheaper than any subscription at small prompt counts, and the crossover point arrives when you would rather not maintain the infrastructure.",
	},
	{
		question: "Which open-source AEO tool is the most actively maintained?",
		answer:
			"By GitHub activity on 11 August 2026, Elmo has the strongest sustained record: 862 commits over 13 months, 206 in the last 90 days, 19 releases, and 10 contributors. Canonry logged more raw commits in that window (500), but 451 came from one developer and it is source-available rather than open source. OneGlanse has not had a commit since 10 May 2026, and GEO/AEO Tracker and GetCito have 28 and 35 total commits respectively.",
	},
	{
		question: "Is there an open-source AI visibility tracker?",
		answer:
			"Yes. Elmo is an open-source AI visibility platform released under the MIT license, and you can self-host it for free. A few smaller open-source projects exist too, though the space is still early. For anything they don't cover, you can script your own checks against the AI model APIs.",
	},
	{
		question: "Is there an open-source alternative to Profound or enterprise AEO tools?",
		answer:
			"Yes. Elmo is an open-source, self-hostable alternative to enterprise platforms like Profound. It tracks how AI answer engines mention and cite your brand, benchmarks competitors, and exports your data, all under the MIT license with every metric computed by code you can read. You run the infrastructure and supply your own model API keys instead of paying a subscription.",
	},
	{
		question: "Should I use GetCito or Elmo?",
		answer:
			"Use Elmo. If you are considering GetCito, Elmo is what you actually want, because GetCito is a fork of it — on 10 July 2026 it replaced its codebase with Elmo's. Everything it offers came from Elmo, and it has shipped less since — 17 commits to Elmo's 98 in the month after the fork — so it is drifting further behind rather than building past it.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can I self-host an AEO tool?",
		answer:
			"Yes. Several open-source answer engine optimization tools are built to self-host. Elmo runs on Docker and PostgreSQL on your own infrastructure, so your prompts and visibility history never leave your environment. OneGlanse, GEO/AEO Tracker, and Canonry are self-hostable too. You bring your own LLM API keys, which carry usage costs, but there is no license fee or per-seat charge.",
	},
	{
		question: "Can I build my own AI visibility tool?",
		answer:
			"You can. The core loop is straightforward: send your prompts to the model APIs, directly or through a router like OpenRouter, parse each answer for brand mentions and citations, and log the results over time. The work is in maintaining it, covering enough engines, and running it at scale, which is what a finished tool handles for you.",
	},
	{
		question: "Why use an open-source AI visibility tool?",
		answer:
			"Because you can audit it and own it. With open source, you read exactly how each visibility metric is collected and computed instead of trusting a black-box score that might land in a board report. You self-host it, so prompts and history stay on your own infrastructure, and there is nothing to migrate off if you switch. No vendor lock-in.",
	},
	{
		question: "Is Elmo really open source?",
		answer:
			"Yes. Every line of Elmo is open source under the MIT license and available on GitHub. You can read exactly how each metric is collected and computed, self-host it on your own infrastructure for free, and export your data at any time.",
	},

							<h3 className="font-heading mb-3 text-lg text-zinc-950">Elmo</h3>
							<p>
								Elmo is the most complete open-source AI visibility platform on this list. It is released under the MIT
								license, free to self-host, and every metric is computed by code you can read. It tracks how AI answer
								engines mention and cite your brand across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, and Google's AI
								Overviews, among other engines, then turns that into a visibility score, citation analytics,
								brand-mention tracking, and competitor benchmarking. You can export everything through the API, and
								agencies can white-label it.
							</p>
							<p className="mt-4">
								It fits teams that want to own their AEO data outright. The self-hosted core runs on Docker and
								PostgreSQL. You supply your own model API keys, which carry usage costs, and there is no license fee or
								per-seat charge. Elmo does not do sentiment analysis, prompt-volume estimates, content generation,
								shopping-result tracking, or geographic breakdowns. It measures visibility and citations well, and
								leaves the content work to you. Managed cloud hosting is available for teams that would rather not run
								the infrastructure.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3 className="font-heading mb-3 text-lg text-zinc-950">OneGlanse</h3>
							<p>
								OneGlanse is an MIT-licensed, self-hosted tracker covering ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, and
								Google AI Overview. Its distinguishing choice is how it collects answers. Instead of hitting the model
								APIs, it captures responses through authenticated accounts on the AI web interfaces, which is closer to
								what a real user sees. Data lands in a ClickHouse backend on your own infrastructure, and you bring your
								own API keys.
							</p>
							<p className="mt-4">
								It suits developers who care that the answers being scored come from the actual chat products, not the
								API surface, and who are comfortable standing up ClickHouse. The idea is good and the approach is
								genuinely different from everything else here. Check the activity before you build on it, though. Its
								496 commits landed in a single burst between 15 April and 10 May 2026, and the repository has not had a
								commit since. It has one contributor and no tagged releases.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3 className="font-heading mb-3 text-lg text-zinc-950">GEO/AEO Tracker</h3>
							<p>
								GEO/AEO Tracker is an MIT-licensed, local-first dashboard for watching brand visibility across six
								platforms: ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Copilot, Google AI Overview, and Grok. It stores everything
								client-side in IndexedDB, with no external database to run, and you provide your own keys for data
								fetching and model inference.
							</p>
							<p className="mt-4">
								The local-first design is the appeal: nothing leaves your browser, setup is light, and the platform
								coverage is broad for a solo project. Scope is the limit. It is a single-user tool built around one
								person's dashboard rather than a team platform, so treat it as a personal monitor rather than shared
								infrastructure.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3 className="font-heading mb-3 text-lg text-zinc-950">Canonry</h3>
							<p>
								Canonry is the most ambitious of the independent projects. It is a self-hosted, agent-first AEO platform
								that tracks how Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and local models cite your site, ingests server
								logs to measure AI-driven traffic, and integrates with Google Search Console, GA4, Bing Webmaster, and
								Google Business Profile. A built-in agent named Aero exposes a 67-tool MCP adapter, and clients are
								configured declaratively in YAML.
							</p>
							<p className="mt-4">
								One caveat on the "open source" label. Canonry ships under the FSL-1.1-ALv2, a source-available license
								that converts to Apache 2.0 after two years. You can read and self-host the code today, but it is not
								OSI open source in the strict sense until that conversion. If server-log attribution and agent workflows
								matter to you, it is worth a look, with that license nuance understood.
							</p>

							<h3 className="font-heading mb-3 text-lg text-zinc-950">GetCito</h3>
							<p>
								<strong className="font-medium text-zinc-900">If you are considering GetCito, use Elmo instead.</strong>{" "}

						<div>
							<h3 className="font-heading mb-3 text-lg text-zinc-950">Gego</h3>
							<p>
								Gego is a GPL-3.0 GEO tracker you self-host from Docker Hub. It schedules prompts across generative
								engines on a cron, then captures citations, brand mentions, and extracted keywords, with competitor and
								alias tracking alongside them. It queries OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Perplexity, and it will also
								point at Ollama or a custom provider, so you can run the whole loop against local models. There is a
								dashboard, a CLI, and a REST API.
							</p>
							<p className="mt-4">
								Two caveats. A full deployment expects PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and etcd, which is a heavier footprint than
								a single-container deploy. And GPL-3.0 is copyleft rather than permissive, so unlike the MIT projects
								here it constrains what you can build on top of it and redistribute.

				<DirectorySection title="Build it yourself: scripting AI visibility checks">
					<div className="max-w-3xl space-y-5 leading-relaxed text-zinc-600">
						<p>
							If no existing tool fits, the underlying job is not complicated to script. Send your prompts to the model
							APIs, directly or through a router like OpenRouter, then parse each response for your brand name and any
							links back to your site. Store the results and repeat on a schedule, because a single run is a snapshot
							and answers shift over time.
						</p>
						<p>
							Everything around that loop is the work. You have to cover enough engines, handle the ones without clean
							APIs, keep it running, and build some way to actually read the output. That upkeep is most of what you pay
							for when you buy a tool, or skip by self-hosting one that already does it.

						The choice is really about who does the work and who holds the data. Enterprise AEO software gives you a
						hosted dashboard your team can open tomorrow, managed engine coverage, and a vendor who keeps it running, in
						exchange for a subscription and a scoring model you cannot inspect. Self-hosting an open-source tool trades
						that for no license fee, auditable metrics, and your data on your own machines, with the cost moving from a
						subscription line to engineering time.

						<p>
							Start with how you will use it rather than with a feature grid. If you want full control, auditable

							an unmaintained tracker quietly stops being correct rather than visibly breaking.

							Then weigh coverage, maintenance, and your own capacity to run infrastructure against what a managed
							subscription would cost. If you have no time to self-host, that is useful to know early: see the{" "}
