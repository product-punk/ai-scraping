# @elmohq/cli

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- 2043438: Add SearchApi.io as a scraper provider for ChatGPT, Perplexity, Copilot, Gemini, Google AI Mode, and Google AI Overview.

## 0.4.1

No changes in this release.

## 0.4.0

### Patch Changes

- 859447d: `elmo init` now checks Docker before the setup wizard and reports whether Docker is missing or not running.

## 0.3.0

### Patch Changes

- 3ba2e5a: `elmo init` now says up front that a managed cloud option exists, and what it costs, before walking through self-hosted setup.
- 1f46b62: Fix broken docs link in `elmo init` and the LLMs settings page.
- 5b90bbc: The worker now gets time to finish in-flight jobs when a deployment stops or upgrades, instead of being killed mid-evaluation.

## 0.2.19

### Patch Changes

- dffaae8: New deployments now run Postgres 18. Existing deployments are unaffected and keep the Postgres version they were created with.

## 0.2.18

### Patch Changes

- 4a7c85c: Oxylabs requests now use the asynchronous jobs API instead of the Realtime API, which Oxylabs is deprecating. If you have any `:oxylabs` targets in `SCRAPE_TARGETS`, upgrade before August 31, 2026 to avoid failures.
- 6788467: Add Cloro as a scraper provider for ChatGPT, Perplexity, Copilot, Gemini, Google AI Mode, and Google AI Overview.
- bfa6282: BREAKING CHANGE: DataForSEO now scrapes the real ChatGPT and Gemini interfaces instead of calling their model APIs, with no change needed to existing `SCRAPE_TARGETS`. This is more expensive (about $0.004 instead of $0.0006 to run). This could also impact visibility/citations as it switches to better reflect what users see in the actual chat website. If you would prefer to keep the old behavior, you will need to update your `SCRAPE_TARGETS` to pin the specific version of the model (`chatgpt:dataforseo:gpt-5.5:online` or `gemini:dataforseo:gemini-2.5-flash:online`) to keep using the LLM Responses API instead of the LLM Scraper API.
- c2ae13a: Added an `ELMO_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to new and upgraded deployments, which Elmo now requires to encrypt provider credentials stored in the database.

## 0.2.17

### Patch Changes

- 93a79f2: You can now track Google AI Overviews via the BrightData, DataForSEO, and Oxylabs providers; `SCRAPE_TARGETS` now accepts `google-ai-overview:brightdata:online`, `google-ai-overview:dataforseo:online`, and `google-ai-overview:oxylabs:online`.
- c2fdd26: Grok is now only supported via OpenRouter, since unauthenticated access has been removed and all Grok scrapers are permanently failing.
- c2fdd26: Started tracking Kimi K3 on the [provider status page](https://www.elmohq.com/status). You can configure tracking with `SCRAPE_TARGETS`, which accepts `kimi:openrouter:moonshotai/kimi-k3`.

## 0.2.16

## 0.2.15

### Patch Changes

- d89b787: Add an optional `JINA_API_KEY` env var to avoid anonymous rate limits when fetching website content during brand onboarding.

## 0.2.14

### Patch Changes

- 0e90384: Add `elmo upgrade` to move a local deployment to the version supported by the installed CLI: runs any registered migrations, re-pins the Docker image tags, and restarts the stack (only if it was running before). Warns when the CLI itself is behind the latest published release.
- 8ef5e23: Add ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Gemini support to the DataForSEO provider. `elmo init` now offers them when you enable DataForSEO, and `SCRAPE_TARGETS` accepts `chatgpt:dataforseo:online`, `perplexity:dataforseo:online`, and `gemini:dataforseo:online` (override the underlying model via the version slug, e.g. `chatgpt:dataforseo:gpt-5-mini:online`). Configure via `DATAFORSEO_LOGIN` + `DATAFORSEO_PASSWORD`.
- d64c8fa: Add Oxylabs as a scraper provider. `elmo init` now offers Oxylabs alongside BrightData and Olostep, and `SCRAPE_TARGETS` accepts `chatgpt:oxylabs[:online]`, `perplexity:oxylabs:online`, and `google-ai-mode:oxylabs:online`. Configure via `OXYLABS_USERNAME` + `OXYLABS_PASSWORD`.

## 0.2.13

## 0.2.12

## 0.2.11

### Patch Changes

- 4ccba7a: Make `--dir` a global CLI option. It applies to `init`, `compose`, and `edit`, and now shows up in `elmo --help` as well as each subcommand's help.
- 4ccba7a: `elmo -h` now makes clear what `elmo edit` lets you change and which targets it accepts.
- 4ccba7a: Pin generated `docker-compose.yml` image tags to the CLI's version (e.g. `elmohq/elmo-web:0.2.10`) instead of `latest`, so stacks stay on the version they were initialized with until the user upgrades.
- 4ccba7a: Remove `elmo status` — use `elmo compose ps` instead.

## 0.2.10

### Patch Changes

- 1f9c1cd: Default the CLI config directory to `~/.elmo`.
- ac355fd: Prompt for the web app port in `elmo init` (defaults to 1515).
- afbd561: Recommended `elmo init` setup no longer adds direct-API query targets — only scraping tracks ChatGPT and Google AI Mode.
- 19eacbc: Add `elmo edit`, drop `elmo telemetry` and the `~/.elmo/config.json` file. `elmo edit env|compose` opens the file in `$VISUAL` / `$EDITOR` (fallback `nano`) — toggle `DISABLE_TELEMETRY` there instead of via the removed `elmo telemetry` subcommand. Telemetry state and the deployment ID now live entirely in `.env`; `elmo init` stamps the CLI version and timestamp into the `.env` and `elmo.yaml` headers, and re-running it preserves the existing `DEPLOYMENT_ID`.
- 063e33e: Remove `elmo start`, `elmo stop`, `elmo logs`, and `elmo build` aliases — use `elmo compose <args>` directly (e.g. `elmo compose up -d`, `elmo compose down`, `elmo compose logs -f`, `elmo compose build`).

## 0.2.9

### Patch Changes

- 3d378c2: Clean up wording in `elmo init`.

## 0.2.8

### Patch Changes

- c576cee: Publish `elmohq/elmo-db-migrate` images instead of always attempting to build as part of the CLI.

## 0.2.7

### Patch Changes

- 1e770ff: Standardize Docker image naming between the CLI and release process on `elmohq/elmo-web` and `elmohq/elmo-worker`.

## 0.2.6

## 0.2.5

### Patch Changes

- 839b98b: `elmo init` adds a recommended setup path — pick a scraper (BrightData or Olostep), pick a direct LLM API (OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, or Mistral), four prompts total. The custom path now requires at least one direct LLM API so onboarding analysis works out of the box.
- 76e2a5f: Add telemetry opt-out prompt during `elmo init` and new `elmo telemetry status|enable|disable` subcommand. See [Telemetry](https://elmohq.com/docs/developer-guide/telemetry) for what's collected.
- edf97d4: Add Mistral as a direct API provider. Set `MISTRAL_API_KEY` and target via `mistral:mistral-api:<model>[:online]`.
- 7cba46d: License Elmo under the MIT License. Add Code of Conduct, Contributing guide, Security policy, and a lightweight CLA process.

## 0.2.4

### Patch Changes

- 67a0389: Fix local-mode registration end-to-end and lock down the auth surface. The first `/auth/register` submission in local mode now atomically creates the default org + admin membership, so register → brand onboarding works in one pass; any subsequent signup is rejected. Demo mode narrows writable `/api/auth/**` endpoints to a whitelist of just sign-in and sign-out. Drops the unused `DEFAULT_ORG_ID` and `DEFAULT_ORG_NAME` env vars.

## 0.2.3

## 0.2.2

### Patch Changes

- fa45737: CLI: mask the external `DATABASE_URL` prompt and note that it must be an IPv4-compatible direct connection or pooler.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- adf7642: CLI `elmo init` now walks through each provider one at a time.

## 0.2.0

## 0.1.2

## 0.1.1
