/**
 * Bring prompts' next cycle forward after a configuration change — platforms
 * added to a brand, a premium model added to a prompt — so the change takes
 * effect now rather than whenever the current cadence happens to come around.
 *
 * Dragging the queued row forward is required because the `prompt-${id}`
 * singleton rejects a new send while a future job exists. This is the same update the worker's
 * schedule-maintenance uses to revive stalled chains.
 *
 * Safe to call on any save, and cheap: the cycle it triggers runs only the
 * targets that are actually due, so platforms that ran recently are skipped
 * rather than paid for a second time.
 *
 * Best-effort by design. A prompt whose cycle is mid-flight has no queued row
 * to move and holds the singleton against a new one, so its added target waits
 * for maintenance to expedite the job that cycle queues on its way out.
