/**
 * Server-only helpers for the async brand-analysis job.
 *
 * All pg-boss coupling for the onboarding analysis lives here so the server
 * functions in `@/server/onboarding` stay thin (and free of direct db
 * imports). The web app enqueues the work and then polls the job's result
 * *by brand* — the brand id is the org id, so callers prove access to the
 * brand and we never hand a job's output to someone outside that org.
 *
 * Reading the result goes straight at pg-boss's `pgboss.job` table rather than
 * `getJobById`, because the client polls by brand (not by an opaque job id it
 * has to round-trip). The columns used here (`name`, `data`, `state`,
 * `output`, `created_on`) are stable across the pinned pg-boss v12 line.
