/**
 * Pure, dependency-free statistics for AI-visibility analysis.
 *
 * These power the Share of Voice page and the Opportunities digest's stability
 * scores. They take plain aggregated rows (produced by the
 * postgres read layer) and never touch IO, so they are unit-testable in
 * isolation.
 *
 * Two notions of "how much do the cited sources move over time" live here and
 * are deliberately kept distinct — in practice they are near-orthogonal:
 *   - set volatility:      churn in the *set* of cited domains (Jaccard distance).
 *   - weighted volatility: churn weighted by citation *volume* (Bray–Curtis on
 *     the daily citation-share vectors). A prompt with one dominant source every
 *     day but a noisy long tail looks volatile by set yet stable by volume —
 *     weighted is the truer "do the sources that carry the answer move?" signal,
 *     so it's the one we surface as the Stability score.
