/**
 * How the LLM settings page groups tracked platforms.
 *
 * The three groups answer different questions about a brand, which is why they
 * are separate cards with their own copy rather than one grid of pills: a
 * scraped surface tells you what a visitor sees, an ungrounded API call tells
 * you what the model already believes, and a grounded one tells you what it
 * finds and cites. They also behave differently — grounded calls cost roughly
 * ten times an ungrounded one, so in cloud they are metered per prompt instead
 * of picked per brand.
 *
 * The tiers themselves — their ids and names — belong to the plan catalog,
 * which prices them. Only the long descriptions live here, because this page is
 * the one surface with room for them.
