/**
 * Provider-agnostic onboarding research.
 *
 * Onboarding always runs against a direct API provider (Anthropic / OpenAI /
 * OpenRouter / Mistral) — the deployment guarantees one is configured, and
 * the CLI's setup wizard enforces it. Each provider implements
 * `runStructuredResearch<T>(prompt, schema)` itself, picking the most
 * idiomatic combo for its API:
 *   • Anthropic / OpenAI — `generateText` + native web-search tool +
 *     `output: Output.object(schema)`.
 *   • OpenRouter — `generateObject` against a `:online`-suffixed slug
 *     (web search baked into the route).
 *   • Mistral — OpenAI-compat `generateObject` (no web search; users who
 *     want it should target a different provider via ONBOARDING_LLM_TARGET).
 *
 * This module's job is just to pick the right provider and forward the call.
 * No prompt wrappers, no JSON parsing, no two-pass anything.
 *
 * `ONBOARDING_LLM_TARGET` (parsed like a SCRAPE_TARGETS entry) overrides the
 * preference order if a deployment wants a specific provider/model.
