/**
 * Schedule-time run policy: which targets a prompt should run, at what
 * per-target cadence, with what replication — resolved fresh on every firing
 * so subscription changes, plan changes, and platform-pick edits apply without
 * touching queued jobs.
 *
 * Two halves, both pure:
 *  - resolvePromptRunPlan: the prompt's target set + intervals.
 *  - selectDueTargets: which of those targets are actually due, metered
 *    against real prompt_runs history. Metering against history (rather than
 *    trusting the job cadence) is what makes per-target cadence work with the
 *    existing one-job-per-prompt scheduler, keeps in-flight jobs from before
 *    an upgrade valid, and structurally prevents duplicate-fire oversampling
 *    (a maintenance expedite re-runs only what is due).
 *
 * Non-cloud modes resolve exactly today's behavior: every brand-selected
 * target at the brand cadence, replicated RUNS_PER_PROMPT times.
