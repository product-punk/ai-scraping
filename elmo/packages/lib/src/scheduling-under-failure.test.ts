/**
 * How much a prompt costs when its provider stops working.
 *
 * Every incident in this area has had the same shape: a target that fails
 * records nothing, the prompt therefore looks like it has never run, and some
 * part of the scheduler treats "never run" as "needs running now" — forever.
 * The individual guards against that read as obviously correct in isolation and
 * still compose into a loop, so what's asserted here is the composition: the
 * scheduler's two decisions driven over days of simulated time, counting how
 * many times a prompt actually reaches a provider.
 *
 * The counts are the point. Each cycle is RUNS_PER_PROMPT x targets paid calls,
 * so an attempt count is a bill.
