/**
 * A no-network provider that returns a fixed, schema-valid research result.
 *
 * It is NOT part of any deployment's provider preference or default
 * SCRAPE_TARGETS — it is reachable only when an operator explicitly points
 * `ONBOARDING_LLM_TARGET` (or `SCRAPE_TARGETS`) at "stub". The e2e suite selects
 * it (`ONBOARDING_LLM_TARGET=stub:stub`) so the brand-analysis path
 * (`/api/v1/tools/analyze`, the onboarding wizard) runs end to end with no paid
 * LLM call; it's also handy for keyless local development.
 *
 * `runStructuredResearch` validates a canned object against the caller's schema,
 * so if the onboarding research schema changes and the canned shape drifts, the
 * mismatch surfaces as a loud parse error in tests rather than silent junk.
