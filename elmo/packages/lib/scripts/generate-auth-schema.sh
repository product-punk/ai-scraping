/**
 * Better-auth Drizzle schema — tables and relations.
 *
 * Generated via:  pnpm run generate:auth-schema
 *
 * The generator emits tables, columns, and relations implied by the plugins
 * in the auth config (the _cli-helper.ts wrapper). Indexes created by the
 * generator are included here; additional indexes added by hand in
 * migrations (e.g. subscription index in 0012) are NOT represented in this
 * file — drizzle-kit snapshots don't see them and would try to drop them on
 * `drizzle-kit push`. They are maintained by their migration files instead.
 *
 * DO NOT EDIT BY HAND. If you add a better-auth plugin that introduces new
 * tables or columns, re-run the generation script and commit the diff. If the
 * new table needs indexes beyond what the generator emits, add them in a new
 * migration — not in this file.
 *
 * One column deserves a warning the generator can't carry: `apikey.metadata` is
 * writable by anyone with a session, by plugin design. Never store anything
 * there that grants access — see readBrandRestriction in
 * apps/web/src/lib/auth/api-auth.ts.
