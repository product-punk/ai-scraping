 * (see e2e/modes.yaml) rather than recreating a single container between
 * phases. The ports and databases here are what that file publishes.
 *
 * Cloud and whitelabel get a database of their own. Cloud signs accounts up and
 * deletes them again, so on one shared database every phase had to re-seed to
 * undo the phase before it, and the order they ran in was load-bearing.
 *
 * Local and demo share one on purpose: demo has no signup, so the account its
 * specs sign in with has to be the one the local phase bootstrapped, and demo
 * is READ_ONLY so it cannot write back. That mirrors how the public demo is
 * deployed, and is the one ordering the workflow still keeps.
