/**
 * One Playwright project per deployment mode.
 *
 * A container serves a single DEPLOYMENT_MODE, so the stack runs one per mode,
 * each on its own port: `--project=cloud` addresses the cloud container (see
 * e2e/modes.yaml and .github/workflows/e2e.yaml). Each mode runs the shared
 * specs — the behaviour every deployment owes its users — plus the specs for
 * what makes that mode different.
