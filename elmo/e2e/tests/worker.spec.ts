/**
 * Worker Job Processing E2E Test
 *
 * Proves the background worker is wired up end to end: submitting a prompt
 * through the public API enqueues a `process-prompt` pg-boss job, and the
 * worker (running the no-network `stub` provider) dequeues it and records the
 * run. We assert on the `prompt_runs` side effect rather than the job's own
 * state so the test only passes if the handler actually did its work.
 *
 * This spec is the `worker` Playwright project and runs in its own phase,
 * after the worker is started. The fixture-dependent specs (the `fixtures`
 * project) run earlier while the worker is still down, so the worker's
 * self-healing scheduler can't re-enqueue the seeded prompts and mutate data
 * they assert on (see .github/workflows/e2e.yaml).
