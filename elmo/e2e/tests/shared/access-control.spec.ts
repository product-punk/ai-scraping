/**
 * Access-control invariants every deployment mode must hold.
 *
 * These are the guarantees that don't vary with DEPLOYMENT_MODE: an anonymous
 * visitor can't reach the dashboard, the public API needs a key, org
 * membership scopes what a signed-in user can see, and organizations can't be
 * created over HTTP in any mode. Running them under all three modes is the
 * point — a mode-specific auth or middleware change that quietly opens one of
 * these up fails here.
