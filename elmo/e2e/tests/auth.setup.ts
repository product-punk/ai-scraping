/**
 * Per-mode authentication setup.
 *
 * Runs as the `<mode>:setup` Playwright project and saves browser state the
 * matching `<mode>` project reuses, so every spec starts as an authenticated
 * admin of the seeded brand. How the session is obtained differs by mode
 * because the deployments genuinely differ:
 *
 *   local       — bootstrap signup (the one signup a local instance allows)
 *   cloud       — self-serve signup + email verification, then sign-in
 *   demo        — sign-in only; signup is disabled and every write is refused
 *   whitelabel  — SSO-only, so the session is written directly (see session.ts)
 *
 * Whichever path runs, the user ends up an admin of TEST_BRAND_ID with report
 * generator access, so shared specs see the same surface in every mode.
