The [ChatGPT Scraper](https://oxylabs.io/products/scraper-api/serp/chatgpt) by Oxylabs allows you to send prompts to ChatGPT and automatically collect both conversational responses and structured metadata. You can use the [Web Scraper API](https://oxylabs.io/products/scraper-api) with ChatGPT for SEO monitoring, AI response analysis, and brand presence tracking. It provides parsed, ready-to-use JSON output without the need to manage proxies and browsers, or avoid server-side defense systems.


## How it works

You can gather ChatGPT scraper response results by simply providing a prompt and valid Web Scraper API credentials. Once authenticated, you can make a simple POST request to the API as shown below.

    'parse': True,
    'geo_location': "United States",

## FAQ

### Is scraping ChatGPT legal?  
The legality of using ChatGPT scrapers depends on the way it is done and the applicable jurisdiction. While Oxylabs provides the infrastructure to collect publicly available or user-submitted data from ChatGPT, it is the responsibility of the user to ensure compliance with OpenAI’s Terms of Service and local regulations.  

### What’s the ChatGPT prompt size limit?  
The maximum prompt length supported by the ChatGPT Scraper is 4,000 symbols. If your use case requires handling longer inputs, consider splitting the text into smaller chunks and sending multiple sequential requests.
